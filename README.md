# Born2BeRoot

## üìö Description

The **Born2BeRoot** project introduces the fundamental concepts of system administration and server configuration.
The goal is to set up and secure a virtual machine with Debian or Rocky while learning about system processes, services, and security.

---

## üöÄ Objectives

### 1. **Virtual Machine Setup**
- Use a virtualization tool like **VirtualBox** to install a Debian or Rocky operating system.

### 2. **Server Configuration**
- Configure a virtual private server (VPS) with:
  - A hostname and static IP address.
  - User accounts and groups.
  - A secure `sudo` setup.

### 3. **Security Hardening**
- Enforce strong security practices, including:
  - SSH configuration to prevent root login.
  - Firewall setup using `ufw` or `iptables`.
  - Password complexity and expiration rules.
  - Automatic updates.

### 4. **Mandatory Services**
- Set up and configure essential services, such as:
  - A **secure SSH service**.
  - A **monitoring script** to log system metrics (e.g., disk usage, memory, and CPU load).
